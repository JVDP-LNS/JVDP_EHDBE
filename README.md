# JVDP_EHDBE
The repository for my incomplete and discontinued Game Database Editor application (Cross-Platform) for the Event Horizon Space RPG game. This is made using kivy in python. Discontinued due to trouble with android permissions and overall bad performance at large ship layout grid sizes ( > 100 ).
